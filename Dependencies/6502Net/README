This is my implementation of a 6502 CPU simulator. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
This project is still in an early stage. I can only guarantee that my Unit tests pass. There are several needed functions missing, and also several bugs/quirks not implemented correctly in code.


Version History
.01 Current Version - All OP Codes Implemented.

I used the following test programs to validate the simulator.

How to Compile Tests - Go grab the AS65 Compiler
http://www.kingswood-consulting.co.uk/assemblers/

Modify the 6502_functional_test.a65
load_data_direct = 0

Run the following command to generate the bin file and lst file
as65 -l -m -w -h0  6502_functional_test.a65

In the simulator Load the test
Set the Memory Offset to be 0x0400 and the PC to be 0x0400.

Program Listing starts at 400
