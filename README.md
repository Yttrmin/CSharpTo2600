# CSharpTo2600
A compiler and framework for creating Atari 2600 games using C#. It uses the .NET Compiler Platform (Roslyn) to compile C# files, and Mono.Cecil to compile the resulting CIL into 6502 assembly.

### Current Status
This project is being actively rewritten to compile from CIL to 6502 instead of C# to 6502. This is being done to (hopefully) ease development and allow for more features.
The old C# to 6502 compiler can be found on the [master branch](https://github.com/Yttrmin/CSharpTo2600/tree/master) for now.
