6502.Net, A .Net-Based Cross-Assembler for Several 8-Bit Microprocessors.

Version 2.3.3

## Overview

The 6502.Net Macro Assembler is a simple cross-assembler targeting several CPUs from the 8-bit era of computing including the MOS 6502 and its variants, the Motorola M6800 and M6809, and the Zilog Z80. It has several advanced features, such as conditional assembly, macros and custom defined fuctions. With the aim of cross-platform compatibility, it is targeted for .Net Core 3.1.

Invoke the assembler from the command line like so: `dotnet 6502.Net.dll myprg.asm`. To specify output file name use the `-o <file>` or `--output=<file>` option.

As with other assemblers, source statements are typically in the format:

```asm
label   mnemonic    operands
```

Comments are either C/C++ style `/*`/`*/` for block comments, or `//` for line comments. For compatibillty purposes, semi-colons can also be used for line comments.
